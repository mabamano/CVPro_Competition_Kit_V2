## üîß Technical Notes

### About the CVPro Controller:

1. **Charging and Discharging:**  
   Charging is enabled only when the robot is powered OFF to ensure safety and optimal charging efficiency. Use the USB Type-C port for charging. You can either charge the robot using a 5V 1A adapter or via a laptop USB port.

2. **Charging Indicators:**  
   - A **green LED** indicates that the robot is fully charged (only visible when the bot is OFF).  
   - A **red LED** indicates that the battery is currently charging.  
   - Ensure the robot can run for approximately **50 minutes** after a full charge.

3. **Battery Specification:**  
   Equipped with a 3.7V, 3200mAh Li-ion single-cell battery for extended operation time.

4. **Power Module:**  
   Supplies stable power to the controller board, sensors, and motors.

5. **Motor Driver:**  
   Dedicated module for controlling the DC and servo motors with precision.

6. **ESP32 Microcontroller:**  
   A powerful dual-core microcontroller that supports both wired (via Type-C port) and wireless communication (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). It handles sensor inputs, motor control, and AI-based algorithms.

---

### Servo Angle Configuration:

1. The servo in the kit is calibrated with a **centre angle of 100 degrees**.  
2. When adjusting the servo, ensure the angle remains within a **¬±20¬∞ range from the centre‚Äîbetween 80¬∞ and 120¬∞**.  
   Operating beyond these limits may cause mechanical strain or damage to the servo.
